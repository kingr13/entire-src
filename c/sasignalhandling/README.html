<h3>1.Description </h3>
    
    The executable file <b>gterm</b> handles the various signals. The list is as follows 

    1.1. <b>Division by zero</b>
        Signal is simulated by calling a function weirdMathFunc()

    1.2. <b>Alarms</b> 
        Time of the alarm is entered by the user. After the aforementioned time,
        a log file, log.txt is updated with the current time and date.

    1.3. <b>SIGINT (CTRL + C)</b>
        Simulated by calling raise(SIGINT). Can be generated by pressing <i>CTRL +
        C also.</i>

        Can be generated by pressing <i>CTRL + \</i> also.

    1.5. <b>SIGKILL</b>
        Simulated by calling raise(SIGKILL).
